# Full Stack Secure Project Using Spring Boot, Spring Security 6, Multi-Factor Authentication, Password Security, JWT, AWS

## Overview

This project is a **full-stack web application** built using **Spring Boot**, **Spring Security 6**, **JWT**, and **React** with **Tailwind CSS**. It integrates **multi-factor authentication (MFA)**, **OAuth2**, **password security**, and more, providing a secure and scalable solution for web development. This project is designed to give you hands-on experience in building secure, production-grade applications.

## Key Features

- **Spring Boot** backend with **Spring Security 6** for secure authentication and authorization.
- **JWT** (JSON Web Tokens) for stateless authentication.
- **OAuth2** integration for secure third-party authentication.
- **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)** to add an extra layer of security.
- **CORS** configuration for cross-origin requests.
- **Password Security** using modern techniques (e.g., bcrypt, PBKDF2).
- Frontend built with **React** and styled using **Tailwind CSS**.
- Deployed on **AWS** for production-grade deployment.
